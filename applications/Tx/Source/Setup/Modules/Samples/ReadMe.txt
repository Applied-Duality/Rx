We are still working on the Setup and the .chm file.

For now: 
 - We also include the architecture deck
   This is the authoritative copy of the latest, and we will update the .chm as we can

- Click on the shortcut "Extract the samples"

The following set of samples will be extracted into c:\TxSamples:
------------------------------------------

Introduction:           Basic usage of the API

LINQPad:                Sample traces, manifests, and LINQPad queries like in TraceInsight   

                        After you extract the samples:
                            1. launch LINQPAd as administrator
                            2. in the tab MyQueries, set the folder to c:\TxSamples\LINQPad\Queries
                        
                        If you want to move these samples in different directory, use Notepad
                        to replace "c:\TxSamples" in the .linq files
